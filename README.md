Definition of PR
================

The aim of this package is to create a post-push helper to avoid
committing mistakes in my PR's.

This helper will be called `pr-publish` or a similar name in the future.

### Needed:

- Check inputs instead of readline
- Add (check) when something is done
- Execute actions for each question in case we haven't done it
- Add list of possible impacts and generate comment with it

### Would be nice:

- Automatic rebase of all branch commits into a single commit
- Automated PR creation and assignation (that should be a separate tool)
